1.Preheat oven to 145oC

2.Line and grease two 9” round cake tins.

3.Combine dry ingredients, in mixer bowl.
Add the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla, and beat at medium speed until JUST combined.
Add the boiling water and mix immediately by hand until the batter is smooth (don’t over
mix).

4.Pour into the two prepared 9” cake tins. Tap tins once, firmly on the counter to reduce
large bubbles in the mix.

5.Bake for 60 mins, until the cake just begins to pull away from the sides of the tin, and a
skewer inserted comes out clean.

6.Allow to cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks.

7.Once the cakes are completely cool, tops can be levelled (if necessary) and cakes can be
filled, stacked and decorated.
